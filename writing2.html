            <p>
          Before I got a blog, I couldn’t believe people thought they were interesting enough to put their thoughts online. And then I made this blog, and now I can’t believe people walk around the world without publishing their thoughts, because I just would LOVE to know what some people are thinking. I sometimes walk past massive university buildings and wish I could open them up and see Richard Scarry-style cross sections of what everyone is doing and thinking in each classroom and office. How fun would that be? Within a half-mile from my room people manipulate lab rats, write symphonies, preserve mastodon bones, perform open heart surgery, and win NCAA gynmastics meets. And I probably pass them on the sidewalk every day! If you have any interest in my thoughts and activities and gratuitious exclamation points, stick around!  <br>
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm not extrordinary, and I have no particular niche or qualification for a blog, but I decided that my marginally interesting thoughts are worth putting out into the world-- why not? I think I’m writing for a sort of Type-II fun, the kind of thing that is sort of uncomfortable in the moment but enjoyable in retrospect (like running!). I love to *have run* and to *have written*. It’s also worth noting that I'm not thinking about my audience much at all. If I were using a host like WordPress or BlogSpot or Wix, I’d be able to see how many views these have, but I’m not, and though I could maybeee figure it out eventually with enough effort, I don’t think I’m going to. Writing to a very small, unknown audience is a practice in internal validation. This blog, to me, frees creation from performance. And I think it's good for me. Send me an email! Say  hi! I would love it! Here we goooo!</p>

                      <p>
1. On planning for the future: Tone for the week was set by a meeting I had with my beautiful and kind and overwhelmingly-midwestern advisor named Stephanie Chervin who studied Chemistry and Dance at the University of Wisconsin and has an office full of very abstract art which she likes to “get lost in.” I’m pretty excited about most things in the future, but she is probably even MORE excited. I left feeling so energized and conflicted because she told me I had “faculty written all over me” which is so deeply validating but also confusing. AGhhh so now I want to do everything!                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2. On Naomi Klein: I’m on a deep and passionate Naomi Klein kick because she is coming to speak on March 12 for a University Earth Day celebration (which I can’t go to because I have to work, but I’m excited to be in such close proximity, haha). She’s really well known for her writing on capitalism and the environment and I was SHOCKED to find that she never graduated from college! She dropped out to write! Good to remember the unconventional paths. Also, I gotta get my hands on her latest “On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal” to read on the beach during spring break.</p>

<p>
3.  On the University of Michigan endowment: Speaking of climate change!!!! I’ve been getting a little more involved with the Climate Action Movement on campus which puts pressure on administration to divest from fossil fuels (currently $1 billion of our $14 billion endowment is in fossil fuels— unethical to support big polluters, but also a shitty investment long term, since we absolutely cannot keep burning oil/coal/natural gas for decades to come). Anyway, at the regents meeting on the 20th, University administration announced a freeze on future investments! Huge win— and I’m so encouraged!!!— but still not divestment.
</p>

<p>
  4. On running, biking, and swimming: The days are just packed! I zipped over to Northwestern on Saturday for an indoor triathlon. The race wasn’t great (… I didn’t train) but my 16 triathlon buddies were a hoot! Chicago pizza! Lake Michigan views! Cardio!

</P>

<p>

  5. On leisure: And then there are days which are not packed. On Saturday morning I did almost nothing at all and I wasn’t even happy when I was wasting time, and it put me in such a bad mood, and I think I’m learning that unstructured breaks aren’t really restful— I get a lot more rejuvenation from planned leisure activities like mountain biking and snowboarding and book talks and potlucks. This is definitely my criminally extroverted Enneagram 7 self coming out.

</P>
<p>
  6. Aaaand here's what I've been listening to:

okay, that's it. 5 day trudge to spring break!

                    <p>

                    It’s been a light week! Have done less than 40 hours of schoolwork this week (does anyone else keep a loose tally on their hours even when you don’t have to?) but I’ve been swimming and sleeeeeeping and listening to happy music. </p>

<p> 1. On Ypsilanti: I take the 4 bus down Washtenaw to Ypsi every now and then to dog or baby sit, and every time I go I tell myself to go to Ypsi more. The colorful early 1900s houses! The coffee shops! The Firehouse museum! Maybe even the suspiciously friendly old men on the bus!
</p>

<p>
2. Similarly: public transit is so wonderful and I just want the US to invest in it more. Is there anything better than peeking at strangers’ texts? Imagining where they’re coming from and where they’re going? Probably not. I really love the Instagram account @subwayhands.

3. Guys I finally did it. I finally read An Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells and I literally cried. The writing was gorgeous; the subject was horrifying. I added a lot to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mzzsiWyNtvFdaXlByLRAUkrAf2inbtKCFRu4OGVOCM/edit?usp=sharing"> <und> list <und></a> I started a few months ago full of words I've learned. (I don't know why the link is so big and I'll fix it later!!). I also spent some time looking the criticism it garnered from climate scientists (which my *favorite* professor Anne McNeil told me about). Sounds like David Wallace Wells looked at the high estimates for warming, so perhaps humanity’s future isn’t quite so bleak. But still. I loved it; I hated it; stop everything you’re doing and get your hands on it!
</P>

<p>
4. On cataloguing life dearly: I’ve been listening to Mouth Log by Sidney Gish on repeat all week (starts with: "on my phone I've got a list of food I ate and people I kissed....... I catalogue life dearly"). I’ve also dug up some years-old notes from my old phone, and it’s funny to see all my old counted calories and hasty to-do lists. I also included a few notes which I can't descipher for the life of me.

                      <p>

                        The deepest depths of my own memory are in a 21st-century world whirring with VCRs and the internet and carbon-spewing power plants. It’s fascinating and frustrating to fathom a Michigan twelve thousand years ago when the Laurentide ice sheet was making a gradual retreat from the land on which I walk to class, gauging out the five Great Lakes, and carving the hills I struggle to climb on morning runs in the Arb. But on a geological timescale, it’s only been a blink of an eye since the colossal, mile-thick Laurentide ice sheet withdrew from Canada and the Northern United States, depositing Long Island on its way out (Cohen et. al, 2014). Its melting may have caused the worldwide “Noah’s Ark” flood central to the Judeo-Christian worldview, and Genesis 9 continues into a call to dominate over the rest of the biome: “The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky…  they are given into your hands... Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.” Sacred religious text and dry geological reports converge only to cue the age of the human development  somewhere around the time of the Laurentide’s melting. Out with the ice, and in with the human. It was around this time, 12,000 years ago, that the Holocene commenced, a geological epoch that comes from the Greek for “entirely new.” Though some of today’s geologists consider a new, modern epoch to have begun in recent decades, humans have been significantly impacting the environment for thousands of years-- it’s been the age of humans for the entirety of the Holocene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Today, the glacier’s paltry remains are a Delaware-sized, 20,000-year-old glacier called the Barnes Ice Cap in northeast Canada, toward Greenland (Lacelle et. al, 2018). The ice slowly melts as the millions of square kilometers of lands it once dominated are mined and plowed by the Homo sapien, sculpted into universities and skyscrapers and Burger Kings. There’s a new king of the mountain, and under his reign, the earth looks different than it did during the Pleistocene epoch. It’s an age of a species at the top of the food chain acting invincible, an age of nuclear power and unbridled plastic production and anthropogenic climate change. Though the Holocene epoch only started about 12,000 years ago (ICS, 2020), some geologists look at the past century of human activity’s environmental impact and call for a new epoch altogether. It is— according to some of the diligent geologists who spend endless hours determining geologic eons, eras, periods, epochs and ages— the Anthropocene, a rough translation from the Greek words for “new,” “human,” and “era.”

</p>

<p>
  The name was popularized by a prominent atmospheric chemist named Paul Crutzen to a newly christened twenty-first century whirring with VCRs and the internet and carbon-spewing power plants. And in many climate-minded circles, it stuck, and while it’s not a formally-recognized term, it’s approaching (if not already incorporated into) the vernacular. (In a quick poll of about 20 friends, roommates, and family members, about a quarter could define the Anthropocene). But just because people call this the Anthropocene doesn’t mean it’s the Anthropocene. The word has squiggly red lines in Microsoft Word and Google Docs. The process to becoming a bona fide geological epoch is far more complicated and intensive than one might think: there’s a whole field of geochronology in which decorated academics move back and forth between field stations and board rooms, arguing about the geological time scale and the markers that divide the different eons, eras, periods, epochs and ages.

</p>

<p>
  For an epoch like the Anthropocene to be established, it must withstand the International Council of Stratigraphy’s careful review and analysis, which can take decades. But the prestigious group certainly think the Anthropocene has potential. The ICS established the Anthropocene Working Group in 2009 (9 years after Paul Crutzen’s first documented call for an Anthropocene) to investigate whether the new epoch deserved a place in stratigraphic time (Meyer, 2018). Debates continue. The group focuses on identifying a definitive geologic marker; there are over 100 time divisions in earth’s 4.6 billion year history, and each is matched with a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, abbreviated GSSP, and nicknamed ‘golden spike:’ a clear marker of geological change (ICS, 2020). It’s worth noting that record of ocean temperature or acidity, atmospheric carbon dioxide rise, or glacier melting doesn’t constitute a golden spike: it has to be geological, because physical evidence in the sedimentary record is the basis of geological time divisions.

</p>

<p>
  While we await the next reports from the Anthropocene Working Group, we remain in the Holocene, the last formally recognized epoch Holocene, which started around 11,700 years ago (ICS, 2020): the time when the Laurentide receded from North America. Fantastic megafauna— massive beasts like mammoths, mastodons, giant beavers, and the giant ground sloth— died at the hands of man (Holcombe arrow points indicate human hunting about 11,000 years ago)(UM Museum of Natural History, 2020), or a warming environment, or both. It’s around the time when modern agriculture arose, and that first manipulation of the biome spurred an Agricultural Revolution which led to cities and complex cultures and a boom of technology. Around The Holocene has witnessed all of humanity's recorded history and the rise and fall of all its civilizations. The golden spike marking the start of the Holocene is 1500 meters deep into an ice core in central Greenland, at a spot where a shift in quantities of the hydrogen isotope deuterium reflect the end of a cold spell-- the warming that melted the bulk of the Laurentide glacier. (ICS,2020) And while the Holocene has only been around for about 12,000 years (a mere blip in time compared the 2.5 million span of the Pleistocene, the epoch before it), some geologists like Paul Crutzen look at current earth conditions and see a shift worth noting in official chronostratigraphy. Out with the Holocene, in with the Anthropocene.

</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the biggest contender for Anthropocene start date is 1950, a clean, even year with close proximity to a slew of impactful human activities, including nuclear testing. Humans detonated the very first nuclear bomb in July of 1945 in the New Mexico desert, which scattered radioactive particles from the poles to the equator. This continued worldwide until the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, leaving an indelible mark on the surface of the Earth which can be traced back to that 18 year period (Waters et. al., 2015). 1950 also has significance related to anthropogenic climate change: a post-World War II emerging middle class indulged in factories and cars. Industry soared, alone with methane pollution, CO2 emissions, and plastic production. Humans hardly had to toil for food, with automatic cow milkers and John Deere tractors and an ever-more-centralized agricultural-industrial complex. Rock and soil moved around the planet at unprecedented rates (Meyer, 2018). The mid-century industrialization is nicknamed the Great Acceleration, due to the zooming, exponential rise of various human activities ranging from population and GDP to pollutants and temperature. 1950 is a year in living memory. It’s when my grandparents turned 8, and the world may not have been whirring with VCRs and the internet, but it had carbon-spewing power plants and radios and nuclear testing.

</p>

<p>
  Paul Crutzen, who first proposed the Anthropocene in an opinion piece, considered the epoch to start a couple centuries earlier, in the late 1700s, around James Watt’s 1984 steam engine invention. Data retrieved from ice cores show a growth in greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane (Dawson, 2016), and this date is early enough to include the rise of factories in the western world and the entirety of the Industrial Revolution. The ICS epoch divisions are generally in the millions of years; looking back in time, the past five have been 1.6, 3.7, 18.4, 12.9, and 21.2 million years (ICS, 2020). While there’s value in finding the most perfect date, especially for a group as notoriously careful as the International Council of Stratigraphy, a difference of 200 years is tiny in comparison-- it’s only .0002 million years. Overall, most Anthropocene proponents consider a state date during or after the Industrial Revolution, give or take a few hundred years.

</p>

<p>
  But maybe the environmental impact of the behaviorally modern human is further spread throughout time. The earliest proposed Anthropocene start dates are the beginning of the Agricultural Revolution 12,000-15,000 years ago. Four of the twenty-nine members of the Anthropocene Working Group would like, essentially, for the Anthropocene to supplant the Holocene, using its golden spike and start date (Meyer, 2018). It’s based on the idea that humans have had significant impact on their environment since they first controlled the biome with organized farming, transforming ecosystems, plant species, and (sometimes very large!) animals species. It would be a geological epoch starting when H. sapiens numbered barely 5 million and developed prehistoric agriculture, and the epoch would continue to include the following thousands of years of progressive impacts of humans on the earth’s systems, including all the booms of the Great Acceleration: population, fossil fuel burning, greenhouse gas production, and nuclear activity, and remain in place indefinitely. Whether the epoch would keep the name Holocene or adopt Anthropocene is unclear.

</p>

<p>
  But beyond the weeds of golden spikes and subcommittees is a larger question of the importance of geochronology as a whole. Will a new geological epoch mean anything to anyone but geologists? Will it steer human behavior toward sustainability? The general consensus is no, that it will not change much of anything, because it’s a geological distinction meant for geologists, not meant for a news cycle that runs on sensationalism or for galvanizing a population complacent on climate change. The ongoing debate about the geological epoch may distract from the issue at hand: that humans are burning fossil fuels at an alarming rate.

</p>

<p>
  At worst, the continued argument on whether the Age of Humans has started yet may be misconstrued into the unfounded idea that scientists disagree on whether humans are causing climate change. When the Anthropocene is summed up as “the hotly-debated epoch proposed to include the time that human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment,” the layperson could very easily assume that all the debate is about whether humans are truly the dominant influence on the environment. The presumed discord would fit with the manufactured idea that climate scientists are divided on anthropogenic climate change, the justification for swaths of climate change deniers’ beliefs. We’re past that point. Over 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agree that humans have caused this planet’s warming: a clear consensus (NASA). In reality, the Anthropocene debate is whether the best golden spike lies in a Chinese lake,  cave in northern Italy,  corals in the Great Barrier Reef, or another one of the ten options the Anthropocene Working Group considers (Meyer, 2018).

</p>

<p>An unusual-- and problematic-- aspect of the Anthropocene debate is that it started with Crutzen’s idea that the Homo sapien has made a significant enough impact on a 4.6 billion-year-old earth to warrant an epoch, and then geologists hunted for a golden spike in the rock record to mark the potential change. That’s not the usual order: previous changes to the chronostratigraphy have begun with an interesting natural finding and later resulted in a formal change. Deciding the Age of Humans based on historical cultures and developments and then searching for a geological mark that coincides seems problematic, since major human impacts may not have geological basis. Throwing together a makeshift golden spike would shift away from the precedent the International Council of Stratigraphy has set of using strictly geological evidence to divide earth’s history into time units which don’t always correspond to “important” events. The Oxygen Revolution 2.6 million years ago, a rapid spew of oxygen by oceanic photosynthesizers, led to a mass extinction and transformed the atmosphere (Lyons, 2014). But since it didn’t have major effects on the rock record, it didn’t warrant a distinction in geological time.

</p>

<p>
  Sticking with the Holocene’s golden spike in Greenland’s ice core and forgetting about a brand-new, 20th century epoch doesn’t discount the hugely impactful and destructive effects of human activity on the environment, but upholds epoch length consistency and keeps the ICS strictly-geological. It includes human industrialization, but starts at a crucial shift in human evolution to give perspective to recent anthropogenic climate change.

</p>

<p>
  It’s been 300,000 years since the Homo sapien emerged: a species of big-brained clumsy mammals from a lineage of small-brained clumsy mammals, and those early anatomical humans spent the first 100,000 years of their existence confined to a small area in the dry savanna of East Africa making little culture or social change (Mann, 2012). And then something like 50,000 years ago, our distant ancestors spend tens of thousands of years developing language, culture, art, and religion— what’s called behavioral modernity. These abstract thoughts, artistic inclinations, and propensities to search for a higher meaning, perhaps from a deity rumored to have commanded a man and his family to bring animal pairs onto an ark. Behavioral modernity allowed for innovation, planning, and around 12,000 years ago, organized farming (Mann), which happened right after the Laurentide glacier receded most recently, a crucial shift that led the ICS to declare on the Holocene Epoch (ICS, 2020).

</p>

<p>
  The current-day effects of climate change that we see are snowballed effects of a shift toward civilization we saw at the start of the Holocene. Perhaps it’s been the Anthropocene-- the age of humans-- for a very long time, ever since the Laurentide last carved North America. The ongoing debate continues, and a July 2018 ICS report split the Holocene into three ages, with the last, the Meghalayan, ending at 1950 to give room for a potential Anthropocene. The Working Group prepares for a final report in 2021 (Subramanian, 2019). But while the distinguished scientists in the Group consider the various options for golden spikes, spend time in field stations and offices, reading stacks of paper and vials of dirt, the planet warms due to the greenhouse gasses humans spew into the atmosphere to continue the industrialization that began when the last glacier receded, at the start of the Holocene.

          “At some point in life the world’s beauty becomes enough. You don't need to photograph, paint, or even remember it. It is enough.” -Toni Morrison, Tar Baby (1981)
      </p>


        <p>
          The back camera on my iPhone SHAKES and for the past two weeks or so, it’s made everything I record trippy and blurry. A youtube tutorial with a lot of likes shows a quick fix with a magnet, but I haven’t tried it yet.
<br><br>
          <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/MAiAEYdm8l29w9KxRc" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p></p>

        <p>
          Anyway, it’s a moderate inconvenience, not just for notes or exam keys that I want to quick copy, but for little beautiful things that I want to remember. Like the the sunrise (which I sometimes see now that I’m fighting tooth and nail to get up before 7), or light hitting blueberry bagels, or geese by the Huron River, or the view from the UgLi study room 2142 when it looks like a snow globe outside of the windows. Mayyybe *not* documenting those things makes me savor them more.
      <p>
But maybe not. It’s interesting that Toni Morrison gave us this quote because she made a career of harnessing and documenting important (mostly, probably beautiful) ideas and words. Twelve years before she gave us the beauty quote, she started The Bluest Eye with “Here is the house. It is green and white. It has a red door. It is very pretty.”
<p>
I also keep thinking about Jia Tolentino’s New Yorker essay a few days ago on “The New Minimalism,” a millennial tendency to rid homes of objects but hoard digital photos, experiences and memories: a shift status signaling from display of physical goods to expression of lifestyle. Maybe Toni Morrison would hop on board with the idea that those photos and memories are still a sort of clutter. </p>

        <p>
Still not quite sure what to think about the quote, but I'll report back if I have an epiphany!
        </p>



  <br>
  <p>
    Here’s what else I’ve been thinking about:

  </p>
<p>
1. I have two exams this week and they’re both in science classes which cover lot of material. So I’ve spent the whole week studying, it feels like. But I kind of like it! Grinding to some good music and juicy expo markers and mood lighting… *chef’s kiss*
</p>

<p>
2. I realized that most days I only eat like nine foods: oatmeal, bananas, avocado toast, frozen berries, kale salad, bagels, fried eggs, chocolate chips, and coffee. That's kind of bad!

<p>
3. I made a playlist of songs with Homecoming or Prom in the title and it's..... been hitting the spot. Like I think it's actually good, considering the narrow selection process. But check it out for yourself (...with only 30 sec of each song because that's all Spotify's embed feature is giving me)!
<br><br><br>

<br><br>
</p>
<p>
4. I finally read Atul Gawande's 2008 Essay "The Itch" about patients with never-ending itches due to malfunctions in sensory processing and it was gorgeous and excruciating and I CANNOT recommend it more! His painfully vivid descriptions of the itch made me feel almost as uncomfortable as I did watching Bo Burnham's Eighth Grade. Go read it!!!

        “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim” -Annie Dillard

    </p>


      <p>
        Call it imposter syndrome, call it hormonal imbalance, but at the beginning of the week I got bummed because I felt like I was spending all my time studying and still wasn’t mastering concepts very well. And I got a bad Pilates review. And I spent a whole day overthinking a friend’s offhand comment that PROBABLY wasn’t even meant to offend me. But then:

      <p>
 1. I went to a Sustainable Finance Lecture with David Blood (who was CEO of Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management before he started a top sustainable investing firm with Al Gore. Blood and Gore the business partners. I think that is so funny.) And he talked about how he stumbled into finance after getting rejected from Psychology PhD programs and the Peace Corps and over 69 banks. And now he runs a wildly successful company, has shifted much of the investing world toward social, environmental, and governance-oriented practices, tours the world for speaking engagements, and says “bless you” to sneezing audience members. How great is that?!
    <p>
2. I saw this Twitter thread about how the key to juggling is knowing which balls you have in the air are plastic and which are glass. And how you have to remember the difference because if you drop a plastic ball, it bounces back, but if you drop a glass ball, it shatters. That metaphor came at the right time for me… I *love* it.     </p>

      <p>
3. I fell deeeeep into the internet black hole that is Caroline Calloway. I have no idea why it took me so long. I simultaneously love and admire her whimsical paintings and irreverent posts and hate her self-obsession. And it was just a *gorgeous* expose. (note: had a weird issue putting the link in that I'm honestly too lazy to fix right now. It's Natalie Beach's esasy for The Cut) </p>


  <p>
4. This image of the Amazonian Pink River Dolphin has made me UNREASONABLY happy.
<br>
</p>
<img class= "image" src="dolphin.jpg" alt="annie" border= "1" style="width:375px;height:290px;">

<p>
  5. Recognizing a year of personal growth:
</p>

<p>
A year ago, when I was training to instruct Pilates, I would feel sick to my stomach hours before practice classes. And today, I teach a couple classes a week, and I still have a loooong way to go, but I’m getting more comfortable in the role!(!!!!) It’s so rewarding to teach classes without nerves or obsessively detailed plans or jumbled thoughts in my head for the whole 50 minutes. I almost enter a state of flow or hyperfocus. Which is so fun, and healthy, and probably good for my focus at school, since it’s a true break: I’m completely immersed in something entirely separate from what I’m studying.
</p>

<p>
I felt the same way snowboarding at Nubs Nob this weekend! I went with friends from the dorms who I’d gone with a year ago. I was belly laughing the whole time. And I was able to pick snowboarding back up! I (barely) made it down some black diamonds! And then I went to the lodge and cranked out part of an essay, and thought about how I spend my days is how I spend my life, and how I think I like how I spend my days.
</p>

<p>
I guess I’m going to have to tweak the balance between being tough on myself and being gentle with myself until I die :')
</p>

    <p>

      	Outdoor Voices broke into the saturated athleisure market by selling a lifestyle that “frees fitness from performance,” that “gets the world moving,” and above all, promotes #DoingThings, especially in slogan-clad cobalt-blue hats. Years ago, I came across the emerging company’s effortlessly beautiful grid lays of minimalist heathered workout clothes, employee yoga breaks, and ethnically diverse, unedited models who were proud of their cellulite. And I consciously crafted my identify to fit their sunny, sweaty, Instagram-square-sized mold.
  </p>


    <p>
When they advertised their campus ambassador program, I applied immediately in hopes of free clothes, and soon received an email saying that they liked my content and wanted me on the Crew, signed with “high fives, gracie,” which made me feel simultaneously validated and disconcerted as I realized that I was going to allow a brand, albeit one I unashamedly loved, to essentially purchase posts I made on a medium I’d long considered a personal outlet. I succumbed to selling my personality and downloaded the required app, called SocialLadder, which gave me challenges, such as tagging @outdoorvoices in a grid post for a payout of the point-equivalent of $40 in store credit. The app also had a feed of other influencer’s posts, and ranked us by points accumulated. I didn’t rank highly. Even though I identified with the brand’s mission, I remained a bit conflicted about joining the influencer culture of inauthenticity and, from a waste standpoint, encouraging people to spend too much money on clothes they probably don’t need, even if the company was at least moving in the direction of environmental sustainability.     </p>

    <p>
Instagram marketing mimics age-old word-of-mouth advertising, especially in cases of “nano-influencers” like me with fewer than 2000 followers, but injects it with a cash flow and dangles the product a click away from a user’s feed: Instagram’s “Checkout” feature allows for impulse buys within the app, and has proven wildly popular in the months since its May 2019 limited release. Influencer generated content has proven supremely valuable, often outperforming brand-created content, causing vast majority of brands investing in influencer content planned to increase their influencer spending the following year.    </p>

  <p>
In response to the blurry (often invisible) line between Instagram users genuinely recommending a product, promoting a product for compensation (sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars, and posting fake sponsored content for the “influencer” status, FTC Endorsement Guides have become increasingly stringent, requiring that influencers clearly disclose sponsored posts if they received compensation.  Influener territory isn’t quite the Wild West anymore, but regulation is still spotty at best. In the portion of influencers that I, personally, have seen following these guidelines (one is “don’t mix your disclosure into a group of hashtags or links”) is miniscule at best, probably less than one percent (I haven’t found any objective data).  Outdoor Voices never mentioned anything about disclosure to me.
  </p>

    <p>
The August WSJ essay “The Lonely Burden of Today’s Teenage Girls” examined young females’ role as “unwitting guinea pigs in today’s huge unplanned experiment with social media.” Teen anxiety, depression, and eating disorder rates really take off around 2013, the year I graduated eighth grade, as Instagram became popular. An app I once thought frivolous takes on new weight. Sociologists’ academic analyses of teenage-girl Instagram psyche strike a hauntingly familiar chord for me: I was twelve when I got the app, and my construction of my identify is meticulously documented in squares I posted throughout my entire adolescence. It’s shown me news in real time, facilitated the formation of niche subcultures, but has also caused me-- and thousands of others-- anxiety and body dysmorphia. I was disturbed— but in no way surprised— when I learned that for each selfie posted, teenage girls takes, on average, over 200. (I’ve hunted for a citation for a few minutes and can’t find it. I heard this fact in the Armchair Expert podcast episode with Monica Lewinsky.)  </p>


<p>
  I’m still not sure what to think about the deeply personal dual nature of Instagram-- the way it facilitates both digital community and daily comparisons; how influencer partnerships allow for promotion of interesting and niche brands but also can cause an ethically murky distortion of recommendations. I’m also not sure how influencers affect Instagram’s effects on adolescent mental health. Overall, I think I’m glad I signed on with Outdoor Voices. In my four months, I got about $500 worth of Outdoor Voices product and gained a lot of understanding and respect for the mission, their fitness outreach programs, and their sustainable efforts. I’m ashamed that it all came to an end because of my laziness. There was one challenge that was required for me called the Leggings Bundle, where I had to wear my new periwinkle leggings and mention the code OVLEGS30 in the caption. I was really bloated and the sun kept setting before I had the chance to take a picture. The deadline came and went, I never got around to posting, and I realized that my time as an influencer had come to a disappointing end when I got an email saying I would no longer be invited to participate in challenges, signed with “best,” not “high fives.”

I feel like a new person by the time each Sunday rolls around. Almost unimaginable to think that a week ago I hadn’t listened to Circles by Mac Miller or tried Trader Joes mozzarella-style-shreds or published annierau.com or gotten lost in thecreativeindependent.com or met Devin’s dog or watched Florence Pugh’s Instagram ice cream cooking tutors or seen the new and entirely underwhelming Michigan Union or tasted Meijer cranberry wine or let wind tears turn to real tears as I thought about a “see you later” that was really a goodbye.   </p>


  <p>
  A week ago I had no idea that Jared Kushner’s younger and more attractive brother was married to Karlie Kloss; I knew far less about ion channels; I had barely listened to Beach Bunny; I hadn’t eaten nearly as many clementines; I hadn’t twisted my lips into the word “ponderosa pine” or snuggled up to watch the Jeopardy championship or taught a Pilates class to the diehards as a snowstorm turned Ann Arbor into a barely recognizable snowdrift.
  </p>

  <p>
I guess I’m just excited about weeks where I’ll learn about things that’ll blow my mind, where I’ll find a pen I really love, where I’ll draw more molecules that look like little people, where I’ll finish a novel that sends me into a honey headspace where everything is sweet and thick with meaning, where clouds speckle colorful skies; where I get lost in beautiful Instagram accounts and wine drunk with giggly friends and philosophical at Babs. And put wandering lists of niche personal experiences on the internet.    </p>

<p>
  If you can't already tell, I've been super reflective and hopeful this week. Between applying for internships and putting this website online and turning in big essays, I feel like I'm tying up all these loose ends that have felt tangled up and knotted. Feels like a turning point! I'm so excited! Possibilities are endless!

    <br><br> <br>

    <p>I thought I was smart my senior year of high school after I scored well on the ACT. I subscribed to the New Yorker and looked up the words I didn’t know and then used them in my AP Literature papers. I decided I would be an economist or teach at a college or at least do something impressive.
One of my New Yorker articles mentioned an organization called City Year in a parenthetical. I looked it up and I started reading, then writing, and by the time I completed my interview I’d fallen in love with the program. My parents cried when I said I wanted to defer college for a year. I cried when I thought of the kids whose schools didn’t have the resources to provide them the education they deserved. I didn’t accept any offers of admission. May 1 came and went. I held my breath. And then I got into the program and found an apartment and moved to the South Side of Chicago on August 5 and life was a whirlwind of public transportation and childhood development trainings. School started on September 5 at 8:45. I broke down at 3:45. </p>
<p>I bet The New Yorker would label my feeling as ineffectual, overtaxed, or disconsolate. I was young and homesick. Ten year olds are complex and confused and smelly and wise and goofy, but on September 5 they just seemed terrible. Room 216 wasn’t much better on September 6. But after many headaches, a few classroom management books and the development of trust and respect from both the students and me, my work transitioned from crowd control to the tutoring and mentoring it was supposed to be. </p>
<p>My students impressed me. I think a lot about a quote I'd heard somewhere: “Children are not things to be molded but people to be unfolded.” I discovered sensitivity, workhorse resilience, and genius in Room 216. They started asking to eat lunch with me while we practiced math. I just about melted. As they learned metric conversions, I learned things I didn’t want to know about them. I watched my smartest student run around the halls in hysterics when he realized a shooting a block from the playground was the reason for indoor recess. He knew too much. I learned about incarcerated parents, gang activity, and took punches as I broke up fights in the back of math class.</p>
<p>I spent seventeen years rather complacent about poverty because it was so abstract to me in my plush suburban bubble. But poverty has smacked me in the face, now, and I don’t think I’ll be able to forget it. Poverty is crack-addicted mothers whose children’s disruptive behavior hinders the learning of all thirty-five other kids in class. It’s tears over broken glasses that won’t be replaced, and the heart wrenching statistic that, according to some sources, one in three black male babies today will end up in jail. It’s bearable in the abstract, sickening when it’s a full six of my complex and confused and smelly and wise and goofy fifth graders. </p>
<p>September 5 wasn’t the only day I cried in the staff bathroom. I definitely couldn’t fix the world for my students, but I could teach them three-digit multiplication-- maybe even make it fun-- and that was something. My first three months of proximity to American poverty taught me that my lexicon was nothing compared to my soul generated by love. I don’t think I’m so smart anymore. Nor do I care so much about seeming smart anymore. Right now I just care about feeling well fed, fulfilled, and helping others feel the same. Alternately, in the words of Mother Theresa, “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I woke and saw that life was service. I served and learned that service is joy.” </p>

    <br> December 2019. 4 minute read. <br><br>

    I was an extra on Restaurant: Impossible and then I wrote about it!  --------------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>

    <p>Each episode of Restaurant: Impossible opens with a clip of celebrity chef Robert Irvine shaking his head in disapproval and crossing his arms, pulling his already skin-tight short sleeves even tighter around his yoked-out biceps. “I’m just waiting for the sleeves to rip,” my friend’s dad would say to the neighborhood girls and me as we camped our 10-year-old selves out in front of Food Network on winter weekend mornings. “Chef Robert Irvine has 2 days and $10,000 to do the impossible!” the TV would announce, conjuring suspense as we awaited Irvine’s restaurant rescue.
 </p>
<p> There’s a lazy satisfaction from procedurals or makeover-type shows, where I can watch other people dutifully solve problems from the comfort of my couch. Each loose end is tied up within forty-two minutes, not including ads. With 16 seasons, the show is nearly inexhaustible for viewers, each episode following the same formula. Restaurant: Impossible’s team would travel, usually to Middle America, to make dingy (and often deeply indebted) restaurants hip and Yelp-worthy by slapping on new wallpaper and making over the menu. The final few minutes of the show are the highly-anticipated community reveal, which drives the urgency of the rest of the show (“just three hours before the guests arrive and we still can’t find the right blinds”). But they always are ready in time, and the scores of guests rave about Irvine’s changes in camera interviews. The whole show is predictable; it is manufactured; it is everything I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>So during a busride Facebook scroll, when I saw a post calling for volunteers and dinner guests for a GRAND RAPIDS (MY HOMETOWN) episode, I immediately reserved a table for four. An email arrived three weeks later, confirming my table reservation, and giving specific instructions to arrive promptly at 6:15 to sign a release and get instructions.  “Be prepared to wait,” the email read, “for the grand reveal. This is TV and anything can happen.” </p>
<p> When I arrived at Chez Olga the next day with my slightly-apprehensive grandparents and boyfriend, the windows were covered in cardboard and caffeinated twenty-somethings with headsets bustled around the building with pressing but unclear motives. My grandparents studied the release form carefully. I studied the other people in the guest tent. The loudest and most conspicuous were five Pinteresty-looking moms who laughed and chatted loudly. A handful of millennial couples were there, and a few older couples as well. After talking to a man next to me in line for a few minutes, we realized we shared a great grandparent (I’m not sure what that makes us— third cousins?). His very-pregnant wife was due in two weeks. Already amped on the prospect of food-network fame, I imagined how legendary it would be to witness a live birth on the Restaurant: Impossible set. We waited eagerly At 7:15, our Production Assistant named Allison told us that the renovation team was running behind. “They’re trying their best, but this is TV.” An hour later, the pretty moms left and came back with styrofoam cups of what must have been wine. A producer moved a box of snacks from the employee tent to our tent: trail mix, chocolates, Nutrigrain bars, bottled water. An hour after that, Allison lined us up and we followed her, like our mother duck, to the front of the building. It was starting to get dark, so they needed shots of the line right away. </p>
<p> A blonde, tall, and strikingly beautiful camerawoman told Allison the the line would look better if it snaked to the left, not the right. We, the ducklings, followed Allison to the left, right in front of the papered-up windows. We stood for a while. My pregnant third-cousin-in-law was shivering. My grandparents were grumpy. The wine moms were whooping and giggling, which made me feel even more cold and sober.
</p>

<p>But then, like the second coming of Christ, Chef Robert Irvine descended from the steps of Chez Olga, looking exactly like he did on TV: a glowing aura of ruthlessness and bulging biceps. In his signature accent (which is untraceable… it’s mostly English, but with a lot of American influence, especially with short A’s. His “pasta” pronunciation is particularly grating… “past-uh” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRr5kBaNqLg) he announced to the beleaguered dinner guests that the wait was nearly over, and expressed heartfelt gratitude for the Grand Rapids volunteers and guests. Soon enough, Olga, the first-generation Haitian restaurant owner, arrived in a flowing red gown and neat blindfold. The reveal triggered a theatrical reaction of excitement and gratitude: screaming, crying, hugging. The svelte camerawoman took lots of shots.</p>

<p>Allison helped file us in and lead us to our assigned tables. A rag-tag waitstaff distributed paper menus with just six options, and only one without meat. I honestly can’t remember what any of us got, a testament to its bland characterlessness. In between stops from our endearing but painfully awkward waitress who must have been about 15, Irvine announced that we should blame him, not the staff, if the food or service disappointed us. “They’re having to adapt to a lot of changes really rapidly, and they’re doing an amazing job, but a lot of this stuff is brand new.” During dinner, the camerawoman bounced from table to table along with an interviewer who mined specific and enthusiastic praise from guests. The camera loved the wine moms, and the wine moms loved that camera. I got my two seconds of fame, and single line, during dinner, when I gushed to Olga herself, “this is beautiful,” referring to the bright blue walls and lofty ceilings. At 10:30 that night, we paid the steeper-than-expected bill (dishes averaged about $15) and went home to sleep, our four-hour TV escapade coming to a close. </p>

<p>A few weeks later, I stopped into Chez Olga, and though the interior was identical to the night of filming, I was surprised but tickled to see that the old laminated, sprawling menu of authentic Creole dishes was back. Chef Robert Irvine his team don’t revisit the restaurants after the 48 hour transformation ends— they pack their vans for the next restaurant makeover, Allison told me. The majority of Irvine’s turnarounds prove truly impossible: Food Network Gossip reports that 61% of Restaurant: Impossible locations have closed. Two days and $10,000 can’t fix massive debt, incompetent staff, or burnt-out owners. But within those 42 minutes of runtime, Robert Irvine is an odd but consistent beefcake softy. TV personality (and Restaurant: Impossible Executive Producer) Marc Summers once called the show “.. the only true reality TV. Nothing was contrived.”

    wtf is tapioca?!-------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>
<p> Tapioca has followed me through alllll sorts of dietary chapters of life: It’s been phlegmy pellets in lunchbox pudding, a first ingredient in vegan cheeses like Daiya (whose proud claims to stretch and melt and provide “undeniable gooey-gooey cheesy texture” are tinged with desperate exaggeration, but still repeatedly convince me to spend $6 on  7-oz bags of mozzarella-style shreds), and small-marble-sized pearls that give chewy contrast to boba tea, my faaaavorite Ann Arbor splurge. But what even is it?
</p>

<p> I, Annie Rauwerda, girl detective, decided to Google It. Turns out tapioca comes from the storage roots of the cassava plant (also known as yuca root, which I think is familiar from ingredient lists) that looks like a dirty, off-white carrot, a tuber which contains little more than water and starch. And it’s far more popular than I realized. Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize (http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/gcds/). 800 million people depend on cassava as their primary food staple. (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3278e.pdf), which I think is crazy (though I’m not *entirely* sure what it means [what is MY primary food staple?]). Cassava’s long harvesting window and success on poor soils and with low rainfall make it a renowned famine reserve, and during WWII many refugees in Southeast Asia survived on tapioca. And to think I spent my whole life thinking it was just a more controversial version of vanilla pudding.

</p>

<p> Another thing I could hardly believe is the breadth of forms and purposes the root takes: it’s made into alcohol in a number of tropical regions; its cellulose can be processed into biodegradable plastic alternatives; it can be made into tapioca flour, a valuable gluten-free substitute; it’s fried into chips in various Asian countries; it acts as a glue to hold pills together.

</p>

<p>
  It’s as perplexingly versatile as soy. It can become anything, but by itself, tapioca means almost nothing to most people. One could draw similarities between the tapioca and me during sophomore year of college, but I don’t want to get into it. Maybe in another post. Anyway, I feel like a better person for looking this up, but I’m not sure why.

800 straight words of feelings. <br> ---------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>
<p> I’m so happy that Jayne and Jim read me Officer Buckle and Gloria and bought me bikes and taught me to read and made me cry about getting a 6/10 on a second grade spelling test.  And I’m not sure where to go from here, with stores of social capital and grandiose imaginary futures and energy that’s about to spill over.
</p>

<p> I kind of want to go surfing in Hawaii for the rest of my life but also I want to be a doctor and cry when babies die under my care and also cry when they recover for miraculous microscopic reasons that I didn’t learn about in my whole decade of training.
</p>

<p> And tell people I love them and give little gifts and apply myself in fierce, adult ways, but wander in happy-go-lucky, adolescent ways.
</p>

<p>
In the past year I’ve found Jia Tolentino’s irreverence and wit and Sidney Gish’s suburban angst and rambling lyrics and I get so excited when I remember I have a whole life to meet  other people to love and admire, a life to smell honeysuckle and taste berries and listen and read and feel sad sometimes and happy other times.
</p>

<p>
And I think about ice sheets that are toppling down, crumbling into the ocean and melting into nothing, and how humanity once came together over a deep Soviet rivalry to send a man to the moon, and how we once constructed labor divisions but then rose up to take the shackles off women and slaves. And how our collective action has the power to make serfs kings and straws illegal and coal a stubborn power source and ice sheets nonexistent. And healing babies and having babies seems like such a good thing but maybe this greenhouse of an earth doesn’t think about Officer Buckle nor Gloria because it sees babies as consumers and carbon machines, not readers and listeners and honeysuckle-smellers and berry-tasters. And maybe I could try to think like an economist and quantify utility of babies, but how could I possibly know all the threads of happy and sad and good and bad that have yet to intertwine? How can I know if I should have a kid when I’m ten years away from that decision and atmospheric CO2 is at 410 ppm and climbing?
</p>

<p>
  In a sense I’m unique, but in another sense I’m a subtly crafted amalgamation of the people I’ve met and the things I’ve seen and the books I’ve read, and berries I’ve tasted and honeysuckle I’ve smelled, and I have to watch these utter failures of my species knowing that it’s not my fault but the fault of Homo sapiens, whom I love and admire and not only resemble, but am, in every single sense. I can’t imagine a true bad guy, because I see a smidge of myself in everyone and I can hard to imagine intentions that are singularly bad. I might be an optimist. Maybe I’d change my mind if I used dating apps more.

</p>

<p>
For a month I talked to someone who was fun AND a really good person and it was exciting to see that someone like that can exist, and it made me want to *date* someone if I’m gonna date someone. Maybe I’m looking for long-term. Maybe I should go to church again soon. Maybe someday I’ll grow up and marry someone who tells me the weather so I never have to check it, who spends the early mornings with me, makes me giggle like Jayne does when Jim writes commentary on the newspaper, who calls me out on my bullshit when I make proclamations based on six-word headlines I read on nytimes.com, who brings flasks on hikes and writes letters to editors and kisses me goodnight even though I take myself too seriously and leave dishes in the sink.
</p>

<p>
And if I want to find someone who is beautiful and can keep me interested for my entire life I should make myself more beautiful and interesting and smart and driven and so that’s why I sit in the front row of chemistry and bought witch hazel and applied for a research job in Hawaii so I can learn about DNA and zoonoses all day and surf after work and smell island plants and taste island berries I don’t even know yet.
</p>

<p>
  The end, goodnight, I love you, probably.

</p>

    <br><br> <br>
<p>
  Nobody knows who invented the numerical marks that practically define the college experience. Academic performance metrics cropped up at multiple institutions at the end of the 16th century. They weren’t standardized yet: Yale’s 1785 graduating class first performanced-based distinctions were the Latin words optimi, inferior, and pejor. But almost 250 years later, the 4.0 scale GPA has become as pervasive to US higher education as the red solo cup, and most students first became familiar with the fateful first four letters of the alphabet shortly after they learned them in preschool. The average GPA for students at four-year colleges is 3.15, a little higher than a B average. At the University of Michigan, that average is 3.37, a number that has risen very steadily since the data begins in 1933, when average GPA was a measly 2.51. This growth can be attributed, unconvincingly, to a change in raw intellect and study habits, or, more interestingly, to the growing notion that an expensive education should yield better preparation for the workforce and grad school. Students (and parents) interested in getting their money’s worth, and administrators desperate to reverse declining enrollment trends, may put pressure on professors to round up or grade loosely. When the standard for being considered an “above average” student is putzing but the true average student’s GPA is cruising up, grade inflation helps students get ahead-- in this world of changing baselines, the majority of students have “above average” grades. The change generally is supported by students, but exceptions exist. Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, said his "memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant ... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but got quite a few As, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan."


<p>
During my sophomore year of high school, my entire district’s grading scale slid back in the interest of college admissions; the once-elusive 97-100% A became an entirely doable 93%. Another response to this pressure to maximize students’ post-grad opportunities is to forgo the numerical performance summaries altogether; notable examples of grade-eschewing institutions are Brown University and uberpresitigious Saint Ann’s High School in Brooklyn. One headline quipped that trend is to go from “degrading to de-grading.” Notably, schools that make this decision tend to have prestige and alternativeness to spare: a status that isn’t the case everywhere.
</p>

<p>
  When I worked for the Chicago Public Schools, I found myself grading for the first time after spending twelve years as a student. I also had to make sense of the standards used upon me as a school employee. The 2017-2018 CPS School Quality Rating Policy was the battered remains of a 1995 Illinois mandate to give schools stakes, and the system gave grades to the schools themselves: level 1+ being the best, and level 3 indicating probationary status. Tied to high ratings were funding and glory; to low ratings, district and state meddling. My school’s ranking had just fallen from 1 to 2+, and the administrators’ damage control mindset was palpable— so much that, when my partner teacher submitted failing students’ failing grades, the principal asked her to change the Fs to Cs.

</p>

<p>
I imagine that whoever came up with grades (I imagine them as a singular, contemplative old man in an armchair) envisioned the numbers and letters serving all sorts of purposes: they can be clear metrics of failing students, signaling to schools and families a need for individual intervention. They’re also a track record for higher education institutions and potential employers: proof of responsibility and work ethic or their absence. Most familiar to me— yet still entirely perplexing-- is the aim of the GPA to give students themselves higher stakes to their performance: a system that translates the first letter of the alphabet into a pat on the back and the fourth to a cold shower or slap on the wrist. And that’s ideal-- that a student can recover from a bad grade. That’s why my partner teacher attempted to fail the students who openly mocked the subject, put no effort into their work, and rarely turned in an assignment. There’s a justice to it all. A bad grade should be a call to turn behavior around and to set goals. But in aggregate, GPA get tangled with self-esteem, reputation, and dignity. To some students who lack self-efficacy, or support, or maturity to try again, bad grades can seem out of their own control, can spur a learned helplessness, and give a kid the idea that there is no path to redemption from, say, a 1.5 cumulative GPA.
</p>

<p>
Which is probably why the 2017-2018 CPS School Quality Rating Policy designers penalized schools for failing too many students (ie, if schools gave too many failing grades, they would get a failing grade). It’s why the school administrators didn’t let me partner teacher give Fs to that handful of underperforming 11-year-olds in 5th grade math class. It’s a restorative approach to grading; unfortunately, the grade inflation seemed to validate the students’ misbehavior and apathy. There’s no easy solution. </p>

<p>
Single-faceted school evaluations can backfire too: massive standardized test scandals have arisen around the country. The stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher, legacies of No Child Left Behind’s federal education evaluation. In response to the pressure (standardized test scores are often a factor in teachers’ performance reviews, and can translate to higher salary), teachers are increasingly caught cheating on their students’ tests, changing answers in completed test booklets or give a peeked-at-test-question inspired lesson before the testing. Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame authored a paper describing Chicago students having strings of identical answers in 2002, pointing to foul play-- literally erasing and pencilling in new answers-- by about 5% of teachers. A failure of incentives. </p>
<p>
Now that I am a student again, grades are all-consuming. I took relatively easy classes my first semester and wound up with a 4.0 and found validation and motivation in that clean number— a sense of worth that, in the midst of a demanding course load, didn’t lull me into complacency but inspired me to maintain the beloved badge of honor known only to my parents and most observant LinkedIn connections. My 4.0 was whizzing momentum. And then it dipped to 3.98. If I could go back in time with what I know now, I’d start studying for my Chemistry final weeks in advance. In this sense, the dash next to that A is the cold shower it should be. I learned something. </p>

<p>
  I loosen the knot tying my GPA to my ego; I employ the rational thinking that’s gotten me this far, and I remind myself that GPA— like most educational attainment metrics— is probably some dead old man’s imperfect, workable, well-intentioned idea.

I grew up Grand Rapids, Michigan, home of Amway’s sprawling global headquarters since 1959. The company’s heirs have poured their legacies into West Michigan institutions, building a newer, more beautiful skyline of state-of-the-art hospitals, hotels, arenas, and schools, usually plastered with their familiar last names: DeVos and Van Andel. Descendents with the same last names populate my schools and churches, they’re my friends and colleagues. When Betsy Devos was catapulted into Trump-cabinet-notoriety, many individuals in my West Michigan circles cringed yet held their tongues, knowing that the wealth of her family funds our city. </p>


<p>
  Amway independent sellers dot the globe selling health and cleaning and beauty products, but since they don’t sell in Grand Rapids, I didn’t understand what the company did until I was probably twenty. It’s the first and largest¹ company of its kind, and particularly notable for its aggressive international expansion, entering 100 countries, mostly developing nations, since the 70s². The company is hinged on the American Dream, or the American Way, the phrase it adopted as their trademarked portmanteau: Amway. They sell products to people, but more importantly, sell an idea to sellers: that anyone can build a business with the right tools. It is this mindset that leads success-hungry individuals to buy-in, to mine their social circles for friends and family members willing to purchase products or join the Amway ranks, and work their way up the Amway pyramid.

</p>

<p>
  According to a 2011 FTC report, federally-funded research through the Consumer Awareness Institute, 99% of sellers accrued an overall loss for all of the MLMs for which relevant data could be obtained. Promoting the practice as an “income” or “business” opportunity is, according to the report, “a misrepresentation in itself.” Amway’s business model has been outlawed in the UK³, India⁴, and China⁵. Corners of the internet are fiercely hostile toward MLMs, such as r/antiMLM on Reddit and the 2018 podcast “The Dream.” Despite lawsuits⁵ and backlash to Amway’s intense lobbying⁶, the corporate behemoth continues unscathed: Amway keeps selling its sellers the “tools for success”, who sell their Facebook friends marked-up nutrient shakes and household soaps and leggings.

</p>

<p>
  The world of MLMs is intertwined with the Information Age: most independent sellers primarily advertise their business on FB, (sometimes with posts peppered with emojis and tinged with desperation). With all the post data available, I’m surprised to find so little research published on MLMs and I’d be curious to confirm the 1% success rate, determine average seller losses, time spent in the scheme, and what successful sellers have in common, especially considering so many scammed sellers often already struggle financially, enough to obtain a side hustle. Because independent seller work is done online, remotely, and often from smartphones, the gig attracts many single moms. I’m excited that the BSI could enable me to use data sets from Facebook or other places to encourage business transparency and allow potential-sellers to make informed decisions.
