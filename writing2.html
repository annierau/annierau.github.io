    <br> November 2017. 4 minute read. <br><br>

    Here's a draft I wrote in one sitting that later turned into my college essay! It's reallyyy self-righteous. but. <br> --------------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>

    <p>I thought I was smart my senior year of high school after I scored well on the ACT. I subscribed to the New Yorker and looked up the words I didn’t know and then used them in my AP Literature papers. I decided I would be an economist or teach at a college or at least do something impressive.
One of my New Yorker articles mentioned an organization called City Year in a parenthetical. I looked it up and I started reading, then writing, and by the time I completed my interview I’d fallen in love with the program. My parents cried when I said I wanted to defer college for a year. I cried when I thought of the kids whose schools didn’t have the resources to provide them the education they deserved. I didn’t accept any offers of admission. May 1 came and went. I held my breath. And then I got into the program and found an apartment and moved to the South Side of Chicago on August 5 and life was a whirlwind of public transportation and childhood development trainings. School started on September 5 at 8:45. I broke down at 3:45. </p>
<p>I bet The New Yorker would label my feeling as ineffectual, overtaxed, or disconsolate. I was young and homesick. Ten year olds are complex and confused and smelly and wise and goofy, but on September 5 they just seemed terrible. Room 216 wasn’t much better on September 6. But after many headaches, a few classroom management books and the development of trust and respect from both the students and me, my work transitioned from crowd control to the tutoring and mentoring it was supposed to be. </p>
<p>My students impressed me. I think a lot about a quote I'd heard somewhere: “Children are not things to be molded but people to be unfolded.” I discovered sensitivity, workhorse resilience, and genius in Room 216. They started asking to eat lunch with me while we practiced math. I just about melted. As they learned metric conversions, I learned things I didn’t want to know about them. I watched my smartest student run around the halls in hysterics when he realized a shooting a block from the playground was the reason for indoor recess. He knew too much. I learned about incarcerated parents, gang activity, and took punches as I broke up fights in the back of math class.</p>
<p>I spent seventeen years rather complacent about poverty because it was so abstract to me in my plush suburban bubble. But poverty has smacked me in the face, now, and I don’t think I’ll be able to forget it. Poverty is crack-addicted mothers whose children’s disruptive behavior hinders the learning of all thirty-five other kids in class. It’s tears over broken glasses that won’t be replaced, and the heart wrenching statistic that, according to some sources, one in three black male babies today will end up in jail. It’s bearable in the abstract, sickening when it’s a full six of my complex and confused and smelly and wise and goofy fifth graders. </p>
<p>September 5 wasn’t the only day I cried in the staff bathroom. I definitely couldn’t fix the world for my students, but I could teach them three-digit multiplication-- maybe even make it fun-- and that was something. My first three months of proximity to American poverty taught me that my lexicon was nothing compared to my soul generated by love. I don’t think I’m so smart anymore. Nor do I care so much about seeming smart anymore. Right now I just care about feeling well fed, fulfilled, and helping others feel the same. Alternately, in the words of Mother Theresa, “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I woke and saw that life was service. I served and learned that service is joy.” </p>

 I was an extra on Restaurant: Impossible and then I wrote about it!  --------------------------------------------------------->

    <br> December 2019. 4 minute read. <br><br>

    I was an extra on Restaurant: Impossible and then I wrote about it.  --------------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>

    <p>Each episode of Restaurant: Impossible opens with a clip of celebrity chef Robert Irvine shaking his head in disapproval and crossing his arms, pulling his already skin-tight short sleeves even tighter around his yoked-out biceps. “I’m just waiting for the sleeves to rip,” my friend’s dad would say to the neighborhood girls and me as we camped our 10-year-old selves out in front of Food Network on winter weekend mornings. “Chef Robert Irvine has 2 days and $10,000 to do the impossible!” the TV would announce, conjuring suspense as we awaited Irvine’s valiant restaurant rescue.
 </p>
<p> There’s a lazy satisfaction from procedurals or makeover-type shows, where I can watch other people dutifully solve problems from the comfort of my couch. Each loose end is tied up within forty-two minutes, not including ads. With 16 seasons, the show is nearly inexhaustible for viewers, each episode following the same formula. Restaurant: Impossible’s team would travel, usually to Middle America, to make dingy (and often deeply indebted) restaurants hip and Yelp-worthy by slapping on new wallpaper and making over the menu. The final few minutes of the show are the highly-anticipated community reveal, which drives the urgency of the rest of the show (“just three hours before the guests arrive and we still can’t find the right blinds”). But they always are ready in time, and the scores of guests rave about Irvine’s changes in camera interviews. The whole show is predictable; it is manufactured; it is everything I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>So during a busride Facebook scroll, when I saw a post calling for volunteers and dinner guests for a GRAND RAPIDS (MY HOMETOWN) episode, I immediately reserved a table for four. An email arrived three weeks later, confirming my table reservation, and giving specific instructions to arrive promptly at 6:15 to sign a release and get instructions.  “Be prepared to wait,” the email read, “for the grand reveal. This is TV and anything can happen.” </p>
<p> When I arrived at Chez Olga the next day with my slightly-apprehensive grandparents and boyfriend, the windows were covered in cardboard and caffeinated twenty-somethings with headsets bustled around the building with pressing but unclear motives. My grandparents studied the release form carefully. I studied the other people in the guest tent. The loudest and most conspicuous were five Pinteresty-looking moms who laughed and chatted loudly. A handful of millennial couples were there, and a few older couples as well. After talking to a man next to me in line for a few minutes, we realized we shared a great grandparent (I’m not sure what that makes us— third cousins?). His very-pregnant wife was due in two weeks. Already amped on the prospect of food-network fame, I imagined how legendary it would be to witness a live birth on the Restaurant: Impossible set. We waited eagerly At 7:15, our Production Assistant named Allison told us that the renovation team was running behind. “They’re trying their best, but this is TV.” An hour later, the pretty moms left and came back with styrofoam cups of what must have been wine. A producer moved a box of snacks from the employee tent to our tent: trail mix, chocolates, Nutrigrain bars, bottled water. An hour after that, Allison lined us up and we followed her, like our mother duck, to the front of the building. It was starting to get dark, so they needed shots of the line right away. </p>
<p> A blonde, tall, and strikingly beautiful camerawoman told Allison the the line would look better if it snaked to the left, not the right. We, the ducklings, followed Allison to the left, right in front of the papered-up windows. We stood for a while. My pregnant third-cousin-in-law was shivering. My grandparents were grumpy. The wine moms were whooping and giggling, which made me feel even more cold and sober.
</p>

<p>But then, like the second coming of Christ, Chef Robert Irvine descended from the steps of Chez Olga, looking exactly like he did on TV: a glowing aura of ruthlessness and bulging biceps. In his signature accent (which is untraceable… it’s mostly English, but with a lot of American influence, especially with short A’s. His “pasta” pronunciation is particularly grating… “past-uh” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRr5kBaNqLg) he announced to the beleaguered dinner guests that the wait was nearly over, and expressed heartfelt gratitude for the Grand Rapids volunteers and guests. Soon enough, Olga, the first-generation Haitian restaurant owner, arrived in a flowing red gown and neat blindfold. The reveal triggered a theatrical reaction of excitement and gratitude: screaming, crying, hugging. The svelte camerawoman took lots of shots.</p>

<p>Allison helped file us in and lead us to our assigned tables. A rag-tag waitstaff distributed paper menus with just six options, and only one without meat. I honestly can’t remember what any of us got, a testament to its bland characterlessness. In between stops from our endearing but painfully awkward waitress who must have been about 15, Irvine announced that we should blame him, not the staff, if the food or service disappointed us. “They’re having to adapt to a lot of changes really rapidly, and they’re doing an amazing job, but a lot of this stuff is brand new.” During dinner, the camerawoman bounced from table to table along with an interviewer who mined specific and enthusiastic praise from guests. The camera loved the wine moms, and the wine moms loved that camera. I got my two seconds of fame, and single line, during dinner, when I gushed to Olga herself, “this is beautiful,” referring to the bright blue walls and lofty ceilings. At 10:30 that night, we paid the steeper-than-expected bill (dishes averaged about $15) and went home to sleep, our four-hour TV escapade coming to a close. </p>

<p>A few weeks later, I stopped into Chez Olga, and though the interior was identical to the night of filming, I was surprised but tickled to see that the old laminated, sprawling menu of authentic Creole dishes was back. Chef Robert Irvine his team don’t revisit the restaurants after the 48 hour transformation ends— they pack their vans for the next restaurant makeover, Allison told me. The majority of Irvine’s turnarounds prove truly impossible: Food Network Gossip reports that 61% of Restaurant: Impossible locations have closed. Two days and $10,000 can’t fix massive debt, incompetent staff, or burnt-out owners. But within those 42 minutes of runtime, Robert Irvine is an odd but consistent beefcake softy. TV personality (and Restaurant: Impossible Executive Producer) Marc Summers once called the show “.. the only true reality TV. Nothing was contrived.”

    wtf is tapioca?!-------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>
<p> Tapioca has followed me through alllll sorts of dietary chapters of life: It’s been phlegmy pellets in lunchbox pudding, a first ingredient in vegan cheeses like Daiya (whose proud claims to stretch and melt and provide “undeniable gooey-gooey cheesy texture” are tinged with desperate exaggeration, but still repeatedly convince me to spend $6 on  7-oz bags of mozzarella-style shreds), and small-marble-sized pearls that give chewy contrast to boba tea, my faaaavorite Ann Arbor splurge. But what even is it?
</p>

<p> I, Annie Rauwerda, girl detective, decided to Google It. Turns out tapioca comes from the storage roots of the cassava plant (also known as yuca root, which I think is familiar from ingredient lists) that looks like a dirty, off-white carrot, a tuber which contains little more than water and starch. And it’s far more popular than I realized. Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize (http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/gcds/). 800 million people depend on cassava as their primary food staple. (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3278e.pdf), which I think is crazy (though I’m not *entirely* sure what it means [what is MY primary food staple?]). Cassava’s long harvesting window and success on poor soils and with low rainfall make it a renowned famine reserve, and during WWII many refugees in Southeast Asia survived on tapioca. And to think I spent my whole life thinking it was just a more controversial version of vanilla pudding.

</p>

<p> Another thing I could hardly believe is the breadth of forms and purposes the root takes: it’s made into alcohol in a number of tropical regions; its cellulose can be processed into biodegradable plastic alternatives; it can be made into tapioca flour, a valuable gluten-free substitute; it’s fried into chips in various Asian countries; it acts as a glue to hold pills together.

</p>

<p>
  It’s as perplexingly versatile as soy. It can become anything, but by itself, tapioca means almost nothing to most people. One could draw similarities between the tapioca and me during sophomore year of college, but I don’t want to get into it. Maybe in another post. Anyway, I feel like a better person for looking this up, but I’m not sure why.

800 straight words of feelings. i was feeling reflective before bed ---------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>
<p> I’m so happy that Jayne and Jim read me Officer Buckle and Gloria and bought me bikes and taught me to read and made me cry about getting a 6/10 on a second grade spelling test.  And I’m not sure where to go from here, with stores of social capital and grandiose imaginary futures and energy that’s about to spill over.
</p>

<p> I kind of want to go surfing in Hawaii for the rest of my life but also I want to be a doctor and cry when babies die under my care and also cry when they recover for miraculous microscopic reasons that I didn’t learn about in my whole decade of training.
</p>

<p> And tell people I love them and give little gifts and apply myself in fierce, adult ways, but wander in happy-go-lucky, adolescent ways.
</p>

<p>
In the past year I’ve found Jia Tolentino’s irreverence and wit and Sidney Gish’s suburban angst and rambling lyrics and I get so excited when I remember I have a whole life to meet  other people to love and admire, a life to smell honeysuckle and taste berries and listen and read and feel sad sometimes and happy other times.
</p>

<p>
And I think about ice sheets that are toppling down, crumbling into the ocean and melting into nothing, and how humanity once came together over a deep Soviet rivalry to send a man to the moon, and how we once constructed labor divisions but then rose up to take the shackles off women and slaves. And how our collective action has the power to make serfs kings and straws illegal and coal a stubborn power source and ice sheets nonexistent. And healing babies and having babies seems like such a good thing but maybe this greenhouse of an earth doesn’t think about Officer Buckle nor Gloria because it sees babies as consumers and carbon machines, not readers and listeners and honeysuckle-smellers and berry-tasters. And maybe I could try to think like an economist and quantify utility of babies, but how could I possibly know all the threads of happy and sad and good and bad that have yet to intertwine? How can I know if I should have a kid when I’m ten years away from that decision and atmospheric CO2 is at 410 ppm and climbing?
</p>

<p>
  In a sense I’m unique, but in another sense I’m a subtly crafted amalgamation of the people I’ve met and the things I’ve seen and the books I’ve read, and berries I’ve tasted and honeysuckle I’ve smelled, and I have to watch these utter failures of my species knowing that it’s not my fault but the fault of Homo sapiens, whom I love and admire and not only resemble, but am, in every single sense. I can’t imagine a true bad guy, because I see a smidge of myself in everyone and I can hard to imagine intentions that are singularly bad. I might be an optimist. Maybe I’d change my mind if I used dating apps more.

</p>

<p>
For a month I talked to someone who was fun AND a really good person and it was exciting to see that someone like that can exist, and it made me want to *date* someone if I’m gonna date someone. Maybe I’m looking for long-term. Maybe I should go to church again soon. Maybe someday I’ll grow up and marry someone who tells me the weather so I never have to check it, who spends the early mornings with me, makes me giggle like Jayne does when Jim writes commentary on the newspaper, who calls me out on my bullshit when I make proclamations based on six-word headlines I read on nytimes.com, who brings flasks on hikes and writes letters to editors and kisses me goodnight even though I take myself too seriously and leave dishes in the sink.
</p>

<p>
And if I want to find someone who is beautiful and can keep me interested for my entire life I should make myself more beautiful and interesting and smart and driven and so that’s why I sit in the front row of chemistry and bought witch hazel and applied for a research job in Hawaii so I can learn about DNA and zoonoses all day and surf after work and smell island plants and taste island berries I don’t even know yet.
</p>

<p>
  The end, goodnight, I love you, probably.

</p>

    bombed a final and my grade dropped to an A- which is literally fine but I was upset and felt like being dramatic. <br>  ---------------------------------------------------->
    <br><br> <br>
<p>
  Nobody knows who invented the numerical marks that practically define the college experience. Academic performance metrics cropped up at multiple institutions at the end of the 16th century. They weren’t standardized yet: Yale’s 1785 graduating class first performanced-based distinctions were the Latin words optimi, inferior, and pejor. But almost 250 years later, the 4.0 scale GPA has become as pervasive to US higher education as the red solo cup, and most students first became familiar with the fateful first four letters of the alphabet shortly after they learned them in preschool. The average GPA for students at four-year colleges is 3.15, a little higher than a B average. At the University of Michigan, that average is 3.37, a number that has risen very steadily since the data begins in 1933, when average GPA was a measly 2.51. This growth can be attributed, unconvincingly, to a change in raw intellect and study habits, or, more interestingly, to the growing notion that an expensive education should yield better preparation for the workforce and grad school. Students (and parents) interested in getting their money’s worth, and administrators desperate to reverse declining enrollment trends, may put pressure on professors to round up or grade loosely. When the standard for being considered an “above average” student is putzing but the true average student’s GPA is moving up, grade inflation helps students get ahead-- in this world of changing baselines, the majority of students have “above average” grades. The change generally is supported by students, but exceptions exist. Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, said his "memories of the University of Michigan are NOT pleasant ... the fact that I not only passed my courses (except one physics course) but got quite a few As, shows how wretchedly low the standards were at Michigan."


<p>
During my sophomore year of high school, my entire district’s grading scale slid back in the interest of college admissions; the once-elusive 97-100% A became an entirely doable 93%. Another response to this pressure to maximize students’ post-grad opportunities is to forgo the numerical performance summaries altogether; notable examples of grade-eschewing institutions are Brown University and uberpresitigious Saint Ann’s High School in Brooklyn. One headline quipped that trend is to go from “degrading to de-grading.” Notably, schools that make this decision tend to have prestige and alternativeness to spare: a status that isn’t the case everywhere.
</p>

<p>
  When I worked for the Chicago Public Schools, I found myself grading for the first time after spending twelve years as a student. I also had to make sense of the standards used upon me as a school employee. The 2017-2018 CPS School Quality Rating Policy was the battered remains of a 1995 Illinois mandate to give schools stakes, and the system gave grades to the schools themselves: level 1+ being the best, and level 3 indicating probationary status. Tied to high ratings were funding and glory; to low ratings, district and state meddling. My school’s ranking had just fallen from 1 to 2+, and the administrators’ damage control mindset was palpable— so much that, when my partner teacher submitted failing students’ failing grades, the principal asked her to change the Fs to Cs.

</p>

<p>
I imagine that whoever came up with grades (I imagine them as a singular, contemplative old man in an armchair) envisioned the numbers and letters serving all sorts of purposes: they can be clear metrics of failing students, signaling to schools and families a need for individual intervention. They’re also a track record for higher education institutions and potential employers: proof of responsibility and work ethic or their absence. Most familiar to me— yet still entirely perplexing-- is the aim of the GPA to give students themselves higher stakes to their performance: a system that translates the first letter of the alphabet into a pat on the back and the fourth to a cold shower or slap on the wrist. And that’s ideal-- that a student can recover from a bad grade. That’s why my partner teacher attempted to fail the students who openly mocked the subject, put no effort into their work, and rarely turned in an assignment. There’s a justice to it all. A bad grade should be a call to turn behavior around and to set goals. But in aggregate, GPA get tangled with self-esteem, reputation, and dignity. To some students who lack self-efficacy, or support, or maturity to try again, bad grades can seem out of their own control, can spur a learned helplessness, and give a kid the idea that there is no path to redemption from, say, a 1.5 cumulative GPA.
</p>

<p>
Which is probably why the 2017-2018 CPS School Quality Rating Policy designers penalized schools for failing too many students (ie, if schools gave too many failing grades, they would get a failing grade). It’s why the school administrators didn’t let me partner teacher give Fs to that handful of underperforming 11-year-olds in 5th grade math class. It’s a restorative approach to grading; unfortunately, the grade inflation seemed to validate the students’ misbehavior and apathy. There’s no easy solution. </p>

<p>
Single-faceted teacher evaluations can backfire too: massive standardized test scandals have arisen around the country. The stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher, legacies of No Child Left Behind’s federal education evaluation. In response to the pressure (standardized test scores are often a factor in teachers’ performance reviews, and can translate to higher salary), teachers are increasingly caught cheating on their students’ tests, changing answers in completed test booklets or give a peeked-at-test-question inspired lesson before the testing. Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame authored a paper describing Chicago students having strings of identical answers in 2002, pointing to foul play-- literally erasing and pencilling in new answers-- by about 5% of teachers. A failure of incentives. </p>
<p>
Now that I am a student again, grades are all-consuming. As a 4.0 student at a competitive public university, I found validation and motivation in my perfect GPA— a sense of worth that, in the midst of a demanding course load, didn’t lull me into complacency but inspired me to maintain the beloved badge of honor known only to my parents and most observant LinkedIn connections. My 4.0 was whizzing momentum. Today, it dipped to 3.98, but I’m still zooming. If I could go back in time with what I know now, I’d start studying for Chemistry weeks in advance. In this sense, the dash next to that A is the cold shower it should be. I learned something. </p>

<p>
  I loosen the knot tying my GPA to my ego; I employ the rational thinking that’s gotten me this far, and I remind myself that GPA— like most educational attainment metrics— is probably some dead old man’s imperfect, workable, well-intentioned idea.

I grew up Grand Rapids, Michigan, home of Amway’s sprawling global headquarters since 1959. The company’s heirs have poured their legacies into West Michigan institutions, building a newer, more beautiful skyline of state-of-the-art hospitals, hotels, arenas, and schools, usually plastered with their familiar last names: DeVos and Van Andel. Descendents with the same last names populate my schools and churches, they’re my friends and colleagues. When Betsy Devos was catapulted into Trump-cabinet-notoriety, many individuals in my West Michigan circles cringed yet held their tongues, knowing that the wealth of her family funds our city. </p>


<p>
  Amway independent sellers dot the globe selling health and cleaning and beauty products, but since they don’t sell in Grand Rapids, I didn’t understand what the company did until I was probably twenty. It’s the first and largest¹ company of its kind, and particularly notable for its aggressive international expansion, entering 100 countries, mostly developing nations, since the 70s². The company is hinged on the American Dream, or the American Way, the phrase it adopted as their trademarked portmanteau: Amway. They sell products to people, but more importantly, sell an idea to sellers: that anyone can build a business with the right tools. It is this mindset that leads success-hungry individuals to buy-in, to mine their social circles for friends and family members willing to purchase products or join the Amway ranks, and work their way up the Amway pyramid.

</p>

<p>
  According to a 2011 FTC report, federally-funded research through the Consumer Awareness Institute, 99% of sellers accrued an overall loss for all of the MLMs for which relevant data could be obtained. Promoting the practice as an “income” or “business” opportunity is, according to the report, “a misrepresentation in itself.” Amway’s business model has been outlawed in the UK³, India⁴, and China⁵. Corners of the internet are fiercely hostile toward MLMs, such as r/antiMLM on Reddit and the 2018 podcast “The Dream.” Despite lawsuits⁵ and backlash to Amway’s intense lobbying⁶, the corporate behemoth continues unscathed: Amway keeps selling its sellers the “tools for success”, who sell their Facebook friends marked-up nutrient shakes and household soaps and leggings.

</p>

<p>
  The world of MLMs is intertwined with the Information Age: most independent sellers primarily advertise their business on FB, (sometimes with posts peppered with emojis and tinged with desperation). With all the post data available, I’m surprised to find so little research published on MLMs and I’d be curious to confirm the 1% success rate, determine average seller losses, time spent in the scheme, and what successful sellers have in common, especially considering so many scammed sellers often already struggle financially, enough to obtain a side hustle. Because independent seller work is done online, remotely, and often from smartphones, the gig attracts many single moms. I’m excited that the BSI could enable me to use data sets from Facebook or other places to encourage business transparency and allow potential-sellers to make informed decisions.
